        * version 0.2

            No functionality changes.

            Some refactoring of build rules and defines to remove some of
            the platform ifdef complexity.

            Included build scripts to help generate sbc tree, a pre-requisite
            for anyone interested in building the code.  It should now be
            reasonable (maybe not completely easy) for others to build this
            (at least on Debian and Solaris 10).

            Added Solaris 10 SPARC build.

        * version 0.1

            Build can create a tarball.

            Added rudimentary installation support for tarball-based install.

            Built on Debian Linux and Solaris 10 x86 (32bit) only for now.

            Removed Sun branding
