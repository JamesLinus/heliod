First install the following packages:

  ant default-jdk g++ libicu-dev libnss3-dev libpcre3-dev libsasl2-dev
  libxalan110-dev zlib1g-dev


Missing libraries
=================
  mozilla LDAP SDK (https://wiki.mozilla.org/LDAP_C_SDK)

You'll need to arrange to build and install these libraries on the system.
As of 2011/02 I have succesfully built with versions:

  ldapdsk 6.0.5

but others may also work for you.

By default the build expects to find these libraries in a directory tree
of the form:

  $SBC/$COMPONENT/$OBJDIR/[include|lib|...]

Environment variable SBC needs to be set to point at the location of this
directory.  $COMPONENT is the library name (ldapsdk) and $OBJDIR is a
variable used in the build system, Linux2.4_DBG.OBJ.

These defaults are set in defines_Debian, you could override them there
if you must.
