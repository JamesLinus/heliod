Build-time requirements
=======================
  gmake
  ant
  Sun Studio compiler suite

Make sure gmake and ant are in your PATH.
The default location for the compiler is set to /opt/solstudio12.2 in
make/defines_i86pc_SOLARIS_5.10.mk, or override it with the env var
SUNWSPRO_DIR if it is elsewhere.

Missing libraries
=================
  mozilla LDAP SDK (https://wiki.mozilla.org/LDAP_C_SDK)
  pcre (http://www.pcre.org/)
  xerces-c (http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/)
  xalan-c (http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c/)

You'll need to arrange to build and install these libraries on the system.
As of 2011/02 I have succesfully built with versions:

  ldapdsk 6.0.5
  pcre 8.02
  xerces-c 2.7.0
  xalan-c 1.10.0

but others may also work for you.

By default the build expects to find these libraries in a directory tree
of the form:

  $SBC/$COMPONENT/$OBJDIR/[include|lib|...]

Environment variable SBC needs to be set to point at the location of this
directory.  $COMPONENT is the library name (ldapsdk|pcre|xalan-c|xerces-c)
and $OBJDIR is a variable used in the build system, for Solaris 10 x86
it will be SunOS5.10_i86pc

These defaults are set in defines_i86pc_SOLARIS_5.10.mk, you could override
them there if you must.
