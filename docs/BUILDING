Set the environment variable SBC to point at the location of your
shared components directory hierarchy. See $TOP/sbc/README for
help in creating your SBC.

After that, if you're lucky this will work:

  % make tarball

You'll end up with ./work/heliod-*.tar.gz

You need GNU make, so if it is called something else than 'make' on your
system (such as gmake on Solaris), substitute accordingly.

Extract the tarball somewhere convenient and follow the instructions
in the top-level README for post-install steps.

If you want to work with the code, you can also do:

  % make server install

This will install the server under ./work/* instead of making a tarball,
so you can run it right from the source workspace. You don't need to do
any post-install steps in this scenario.


If it didn't work, check the BUILDING_$PLATFORM file for more hints on
building it on your platform. If there is no such file, you get to be
the first to try to make it work there.

In the long history of this codebase it has been commercially built on
just about every platform of interest so it is highly portable. In fact,
you'll find that the build system already includes support for many
more platforms than those listed here, so it should be relatively easy.
That said, some of those platforms have not been built in a long time
so may require more work.
