Building the web server requires several dependencies in $SBC. You
need to set this environment variable before running the build.

The Makefile here will help you generate your own SBC tree. Suggested
practice is to set SBC so it points to a shared filesystems (e.g. NFS)
which is available to all your hosts but it can just as well be local
if you prefer.

The binaries will be installed in directories which identify the
platform so the same SBC root can used for all platforms.

The source tarballs for these components are not included here. You
can download a separate tarball containing them from the project web
site.

Bugs:
====
This has only been tested on the few platforms I built on. May not
work on other variants. If you try elsewhere, please send patches
to the project mailing list.

The build pretends to make OPT (optimized) and DBG (debug) bits but
the scripts don't really observe these and build the same bits for both.
Needs to be fixed.

64bit builds are not complete.


Steps:
======
1. Set environment variable SBC to point at the root of the
destination. Binaries will be installed under $SBC

2. Set environment variable SBC_SRC to point at the directory where
the source tarballs live.

3. Run the appropriate target for your platform from the Makefile.

Why "SBC"? Originally within Netscape|iPlanet|Sun these components
lived in /share/builds/components, commonly pronounced "SBC".
