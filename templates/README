Now that you've extracted the tarball, there are still a couple steps
to do before you can run the server.

1. Run the post-install script:

   % ./bin/post-install

   This will fill in the current location into a few template files.

   Note: This ties the installation to the current filesystem location.
   If you want to run it elsewhere, extract the tarball there first and
   then run the post-install script.

2. Create a server instance:

   % ./bin/create-instance

   Answer the prompts, most defaults are probably ok. This will create
   the actual server instance. If all goes well you should be able to
   start the server now:

   % cd https-*     (* is the name you picked)
   % ./bin/startserv
